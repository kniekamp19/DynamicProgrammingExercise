This project was created for Algorithms for Bioinformatics at Johns Hopkins University 
as part of the AAP M.S. Bioinformatics degree plan.
This program compares a set of sequences in pairs to find the longest common subsequence
between the set of sequences.

The source code in this assignment can be compiled with Java SE 8 from the command line.
It was constructed using Atom v1.53.0.

To run the program, enter: java LCSMain [inputFile].txt [outputFile.txt]

Note: If output file already exists, new output will be appended to existing file.

Each separate input sequence must be on its own line. Values are processed by line.
Only the sequence itself should be on the line, i.e. don't put "String 1 = ..."
